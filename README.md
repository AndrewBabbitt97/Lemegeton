## Documentation

Lemegeton is a Dalamud plugin which is geared to being your ultimate Final Fantasy XIV raiding and ingame companion. With a wide variety of helpful features for all kinds of content, you'll never want to queue into an instance or leave home without it! Lemegeton does not have triggers or callouts, but it's meant to complement the feature set of Triggernometry, Cactbot, et al with a variety of exciting features and functionality.

The plugin is nearly standalone and does not require ACT, Telesto, or anything else to operate aside from Dalamud, which you already have anyway because who isn't using Quicklauncher? It's very easy to set up and manage, and requires no configuration out of the box - aside from you simply turning on the things you want to use for yourself. While some features may be a little more questionable than others, you are not required to use or activate anything you wouldn't want to; if you don't use those features, there is no risk to you.

Current features include but are not limited to:

- UWU / Weapon's Refrain: Titan jail automarker
- DSR / Dragonsong's Reprise: Wroth Flames automarker
- TOP / The Omega Protocol: P1 Program Loop automarker
- TOP / The Omega Protocol: P1 Pantokrator automarker
- TOP / The Omega Protocol: P3 Transition automarker
- TOP / The Omega Protocol: P5 Delta/Sigma/Omega automarkers
- TOP / The Omega Protocol: Draw tether, boss monitor, etc..
- and so much more, not just automarkers - join the Discord!

Lemegeton also has a Wiki, containing useful information and documentation if you would like to read more about the project, or contribute to it:
