## Documentation

Lemegeton is a Dalamud plugin which is geared to being your ultimate raiding and ingame companion. With a wide variety of helpful features for all kinds of content, you'll never want to queue into an instance or leave home without it!

The plugin is nearly standalone and does not require ACT, Telesto, or anything else to operate aside from Dalamud, which you already have anyway because who isn't using Quicklauncher? It's very easy to set up and manage, and requires no configuration out of the box - aside from you simply turning on the things you want to use for yourself. While some features may be a little more questionable than others, you are not required to use or activate anything you wouldn't want to; if you don't use those features, there is no risk to you.

Lemegeton has a Wiki, containing useful information and documentation if you would like to read more about the project, or contribute to it:
